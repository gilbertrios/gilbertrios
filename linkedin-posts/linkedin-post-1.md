🚀 Excited to share what I've been building!

After taking time to focus on learning and creating, I've built 3 production-grade open-source projects that showcase modern platform engineering:

1️⃣ Custom Terraform Provider (Go)
- 13+ utility functions
- 100% test coverage
- Full CI/CD automation

2️⃣ Production .NET 9 API
- 7-stage blue-green deployment
- Automated rollback
- Security-first middleware

3️⃣ Azure Terraform Foundation
- Modular IaC patterns
- Multi-environment support

All projects are fully documented and available on GitHub: github.com/gilbertrios

I'm actively seeking Cloud Platform Engineer, DevOps Engineer, or Infrastructure Engineer roles starting January 2026.
