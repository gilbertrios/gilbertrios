Building a Terraform provider from scratch taught me more about IaC than 5 years of using it 🤯

Key lessons from building terraform-provider-utils:

✅ Go's simplicity is powerful for infrastructure tooling
✅ HashiCorp's Plugin Framework is well-designed
✅ Test-driven development prevents configuration drift
✅ Good documentation = adoption

The provider includes 13+ functions for data transformation that Terraform doesn't provide natively.

Anyone else built custom Terraform providers? What surprised you?
