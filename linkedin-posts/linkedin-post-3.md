Zero-downtime deployments aren't magic—they're process ⚡

Just completed a 7-stage blue-green deployment pipeline that:
• Deploys to staging slot
• Runs regression tests
• Swaps to production
• Validates with smoke tests
• Auto-rolls back on failure

Built with Azure App Service slots, GitHub Actions, and Terraform.

The best part? It's completely automated and repeatable.
